### The repository contains the clarification and research on the following issues:

* research on the things assigned in homeworks as requirements
* utterly very important to divide the assigned requirements into tasks and track tasks
* record tasks as issues with estimated time,  and actual time spent
* learn about github and features
* learn about coding back end in python (djang)
* learn about coding in front end like bootstrap
* document every research and finding as wiki
* add detailed info and research in wikis
* learn more about how to utilize zen hub extensively to track time
