# Hello github and Hello full stack web development

Unfortunately, software development is not riding a bike. A lot has happened in the 10 years since my last code.

In this project I am gonna be testing my limits on:

* research on the things assigned in homeworks as requirements
* utterly very important to divide the assigned requirements into tasks and track tasks
* record tasks as issues with estimated time, actual time
* learn about github and features
* learn about coding back end in python (django ror flask)
* learn about coding in front end like bootstrap etc.
* document every research and finding as issues
* add detailed info and research in wikis
* learn more about how to utilize project tab
